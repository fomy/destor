General Information
-------------------
This is a prototype of a deduplication system called destor.

Features
--------
1. Container-based storage;
2. Chunk-level pipeline;
3. Fixed-sized chunking and Content-Defined Chunking (CDC);
4. A variety of fingerprint indexes, including DDFS, Extreme Binning, Sparse Index, SiLo, etc.
5. A variety of rewriting algorithms, including CFL, CBR, CAP, HAR etc.
6. A variety of restore algorithms, including LRU, optimal replacement algorithm, rolling forward assembly.

Environment
-----------
Linux 64bit.

Dependencies
------------
1. libssl-dev is required to calculate sha-1 digest;
2. GLib 2.32 or later version (The header files, including glib.h, are required to be moved to a searchable path, such as "/usr/local/include"); 
3. Makefile is automatically generated by GNU autoconf and automake.

INSTALL
-------
If all dependencies are installed,
compiling destor is straightforward:

>./configure
>
>make
>
>make install

To uninstall destor, run

>make uninstall

Running
-------
If compile and install are successful, the executable file, destor, should have been moved to /usr/local/bin by default.
You can create a config file, destor.config, in where you run destor.
A sample destor.config is in the project directory.
Run rebuild script before destor to make subdirectory and clean data.

destor can run as follows:

1. start a backup task,
   > destor /path/to/data -p"a line as in config file"

2. start a restore task,
   > destor -r<jobid> /path/to/restore -p"a line as in config file"

3. start a delete job (disabled in the latest version),
   > destor -d<jobid>

4. lookup statistics of system,
   > destor -s

5. help
   > destor -h

6. make a trace
   > destor -t /path/to/data

Configuration
-------------
A sample configuration is shown in destor.conf

Bugs
----
1. If the running destor is crashed artificially or unexpectedly, data consistency is not guaranted and you'd better run rebuild script.

2. Do NOT support concurrent backup/restore.

3. If working path in destor.config is modified, the rebuild script must be modified too.

4. CMA assumes the backups are deleted in FIFO order.
    > In any cases, the oldest backup is deleted.
